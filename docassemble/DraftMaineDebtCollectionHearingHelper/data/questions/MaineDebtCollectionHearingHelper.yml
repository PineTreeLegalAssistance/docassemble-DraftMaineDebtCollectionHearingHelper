    ME Debt Collection Helper
  description: |
    The Maine Debt Collection Hearing Helper is a tool to help Maine people navigate debt collection hearings, including disclosure hearings. It is not legal advice, and you should talk with a lawyer about your case if you can â€“ but this tool can help you navigate the process if you are on your own.
