  Maine Debt Collection Hearing Helper
subquestion: |
  Use this interview to create a customized print-out or .pdf to help you navigate your Maine debt collection hearing or disclosure hearing, and organize important information about your income and property. 
  
  This interview should only be used for unsecured debts (like a credit card), not debts like a mortgage or car loan. 
  
  This is not legal advice. You should talk with a lawyer about your case if you can – but this tool can help you navigate the process if you are on your own.
