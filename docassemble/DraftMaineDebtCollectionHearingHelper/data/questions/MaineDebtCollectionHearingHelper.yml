  About District Court Debt Collection Cases in Maine
fields:
  - note: |
      
      When you are sued in District Court, you must file a written answer within 20 days of the day the Complaint and Summons are delivered to you. <strong>If you do not file a written answer within 20 days, you will likely lose the case by default.</strong>  
    
      You should have gotten a simple form answer with the papers telling you that you are being sued for a debt. Follow the instructions on that form and return it to the court within 20 days to avoid losing your case by default. If you need another copy of that form, you can <a href="https://mjbportal.courts.maine.gov/CourtForms/FormsLists/DownloadForm?strFormNumber=BCCP-2021">find it on the Maine Judicial Branch website</a>.
    
      Try to get a lawyer’s advice if you are sued for a debt in District Court. This is very important if you believe that you don’t owe some or all of the money or have other legal defenses. If you haven't already, you can <a href="https://ptla.org/contact-us">contact Pine Tree</a> – we may be able to help in these cases.
