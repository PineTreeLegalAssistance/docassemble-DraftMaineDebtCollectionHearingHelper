    The Maine Debt Collection Hearing Helper is a tool to help Maine people navigate debt collection hearings, including disclosure hearings.

  #Step 1. Calculating weekly income from work - converting monthly and biweekly income into weekly income for disclosure hearing purposes. 
#  MEIC = (MEI * 12) / 52
#  biWEIC = biWEI / 2
#  TIW = round(WEI + MEIC + biWEIC, 0)
  #Step 2. Checking weekly income against Maine exemption statute for wages/income from work
#  if TIW < 566.00:
#    wage_test_result = 'fully exempt'
#  else:
#    part_exempt_wage_test_result = (TIW) * .75
